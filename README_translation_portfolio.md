# Technical Translation Portfolio: Japanese Version of OpenAI Codex CLI README

This repository contains a full Japanese translation of the official `README.md` from the [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) project.

The translation was performed with attention to clarity, accuracy, and developer readability. It preserves all original Markdown structure, including code blocks, tables, headings, internal links, and formatting.

- ✅ **Code snippets remain untranslated**
- ✅ **Technical terms are translated appropriately for a developer audience**
- ✅ **Natural, fluent Japanese is prioritized over literal translation**
- ✅ **Anchor links and image references remain intact**

## Tools and Workflow
